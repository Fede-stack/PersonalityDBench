            "I am in a very similar situation, but I told her a few weeks ago and nothing changed. It was really bad timing because she is currently in a break up. When I told her I was in a weird place mentally. I spent two days in a row with her and I was feeling \u201dto happy\u201c. I was expecting a really bad backlash just around the corner and I was getting paranoid. I essentially created the backlash by telling her and having a complete mental breakdown because she was a bit dismissive and overwhelmed. A friend said that I have good chances with her and it really messes with me. I never had a girlfriend and the uncertainty kills me. I write with her everyday and see her like 5 times a week, which seems very promising. \n\nBut I don\u2018t think it could even be remotely possible that she likes me as much as I like her. I know her since I was 10 years old and fell in love with her the moment I saw her. Now I\u2019m 21 btw. We didn\u2018t see each other for years but I spent an evening with her and some friends a few years ago and my brain was f\u2022\u2022ked immediately. Of course I didn\u2018t even talk to her at all for months because I am an anxious piece of shit. Eventually she got together with a friend of mine and at that moment I started smoking weed and it was a pretty effective distraction to be honest. But I never quite managed to forget her.\n\nI am really afraid of her, because she could basically destroy me. I still conquer that fear on a daily basis, just because it\u2018s worth it to me. I basically use her as motivation to learn how to deal with fear, which is a good thing in the long run I guess.",

For years I actively supressed any emotions that came up and tried to be as rational as possible at all times (it doesn\u2018t work). I eventually started having suicidal thoughts and barely could provide myself with food from day to day. Through the internet I found out I had depression so I thought that I would be able to get treated and everything would go back to normal. Normal to me was not feeling anything by the way.\n\nSo I got into stationary therapy for two months and they diagnosed me with avpd in the end. I don\u2018t know how to tell how severe my condition is, but my favorite thing to do is sleeping and I can\u2018t get up in the morning because I just hate being awake. I just want to escape reality at all times. When I was hanging out with my object of limerance a lot, it was the first time in years in which I felt as if I was a real human being. I could comfortably talk with people without caring what they think about me, because at the end of the day she would still be there for me. I was able to feel a lot and even had something like a gut feeling on which I could base decisions on. I didn\u2018t understand how that worked for other people before. Now I feel like I am just dead inside.\n\nI started seeing a therapist earlier this year, but I don\u2018t know how to feel about it. I don\u2018t see her often and all she does is prescribe antidepressants which make me feel depressed instead of not feeling anything. I don\u2018t know which one I like better.\n\nI think I am a pretty intense example of someone with avpd but I can\u2018t tell because I don\u2018t know anyone else with it and even if I would know someone I wouldn\u2018t be able to read their minds.

My guess would be that you are female, because I know females get obsessed with their weight. I used to smoke multiple times a week too. But I have concentration issues and daydream a lot so ssris are better for me I guess. But I am doubting it every day because weed would actually get rid of depression for me.

I have been supressing all of my emotions from 15 to 19 years old and at 19 when I couldn\u2018t stop crying out of nowhere, I thought something was wrong and I basically went into stationary therapy to get rid of my feelings again. It took a while, but I changed my mind completely. Nowadays I think emotions are basically everything that makes my life worth living. Even pain and sadness.\n\nMy father definitely never wants to see me angry or annoyed by anthing. When I\u2018m depressed he says I shouldn\u2018t let my emotions out on everyone around myself, even though he is the one who screams at everyone when he\u2018s angry, but he thinks he\u2018s the boss so he\u2018s allowed to and no one else is. I really hate him most of the time. I don\u2018t even want to hate him, but that\u2018s just my natural reaction to his behaviours.\n\nI have been showing more and more of my anger in front of my father recently, because there is no way for me to pretend any longer. If I would I would just explode one day. The fucked up part is that in the past the issue didn\u2018t exist, because I didn\u2018t feel anything and he thinks I can just go back to being like that. But my narc dad is not gonna keep me from having feelings.\n\nI know it really sucks. You should plan to move out from home as soon as possible. I always have to think about my parents when changing something in my behavior or when certain feelings show up. You should be able to feel whatever you feel like and express that without being judged. My only way to be able to show my feelings in front of my family is just to not give a shit about what anybody thinks, which I know isn\u2018t a typical AVPD thing.

There are people who don't mind shy, awkward or even paranoid people, but they weren't the ones who stopped inviting you. They could also just think you don't like them you never know.\n\nYou should focus on people who clearly want to have you around, and on yourself of course. You don't have to be someone who loves drinking at parties, especially if you have AvPD.",

            "I know it might blow your mind but you could just say \"Sorry, I always get really nervous around new people.\" If she has got an issue with that she never liked you at all, because *you are nervous around new people*. If she doesn\u2019t understand that, she is not even worth your time at all. In my humble opinion even 20 years of therapy probably won\u2019t get you to be able to talk to a girl you like without being nervous. 20 years of dating girls certainly would help. \n\nI know it\u2019s hell and I\u2018ve been where you\u2019re at, but don\u2019t think and just ask her out with a stupid message, bc in your head everything you do is stupid anyways so you can\u2019t tell. There are girls out there who would certainly kill for a shy weirdo to ask them out. Not every girl wants a conventionally \"attractive\" guy, who is confident and whatnot.\n\nIf you ask me just hit her up. If you don\u2019t know what to say, \"hey, im sorry about being so awkward that time, im always nervous around new people. I think you\u2019re really cute so we could go to *blank* on *date* at *time*, if you want to.\" could work wonders. Even better if you can come up with a geniune compliment about her other than just cute. You can even dm me if you want to I'd be glad to help and you can always complain to me if anything goes wrong.\n\nI rejected a girl in school by mistake just by acting real nervous in front of people I didn\u2019t even like while talking to her, bc I was insecure about what they would think about her. If I didn\u2019t just start using tinder years later, I would probably still beat myself up over it. I know that feeling too well to just shut up about it now so I'm composing a fucking paragraph on reddit.\n\nAlso in your post you said you had to look that place up. You should tell her you don\u2019t know the place and ask her to tell you about it in that situation. Everybody likes to be asked about something they like. I bet she would have loved to tell you everything about it.\n\nAll I'm trying to say is that you can be honest about not knowing things, never having been on a date, being stiff and robotic, being a huge nerd and spending too much time by yourself and still make a girl obsess over you. The fact that it\u2019s difficult to get to know you can also work in your favour. If she already showed interest you are really fucking up by not doing anything imo.",

            "I dont think she did that on purpose. I personally have come to understand that I\u2018m just too sensitive and just get hurt by people accidentally all the time. I dont think there are many people who would knowingly make the decision to hurt you. Many people are too concerned with themselves to even realize how the one person that doesn\u2019t talk at all feels.\n\nI think one of the core problems with avpd (for me at least), is that meeting people and making friends is a very casual thing for most people and we care way too much. There are girls who flirt with guys just for fun even though they\u2019re not interested and that should tell you a lot about how other people work. Some people treat relationships like a game and there isn\u2019t anything wrong with that necessarily, but it definitely doesn\u2019t mesh well with avpd.\n\nAll I\u2018m trying to say is that you shouldn\u2019t always listen to that voice in your head telling you that everyone hates you. But you definitely should be careful with who you are trying to open up to if you\u2019re even able to do that. I have found I get along the best with more quiet and thoughtful people who actually listen and try to understand instead of just thinking you\u2019re a loser.",

            "\"ill give you something to cry about\" hit very close to home, I didn\u2019t even remember it until now, but my father used to say that. I was being made fun of for crying by pretty much my entire family and they would talk and laugh about it months in advance. They kept telling me I was behaving like a little girl, so I became a soulless piece of garbage that \"didn\u2019t cry like a girl\u201c. I only truly started understanding what real empathy means and how it feels like at 20 years old.",

I have friends who are like that and you just have to laugh about it or maybe make fun of them as well. It depends on what kind of a person you are or want to be I guess.

        "I use tinder every now and then out of boredom and i have been on dates with a girl once. It went kinda awful and I was really awkward, but she liked me for a while. Long story short: I fell in love with her, came across as needy, ended up in the friendzone. \n\nMy advice, if you are looking for matches would be liking weirdos or people who come across as shy, because they hide their faces or something similar. But the most important thing and the hardest would be not to let it get to you. At the end of the day it\u2019s just an app on your phone. Also guys just don\u2019t get as many matches in general.\n\nAlso just liking everyone doesn\u2018t work, because you will start showing up less on others phones. There is a hidden system that rates how good of a user you are. So you should always like and dislike people to make your profile more likely to be liked.\n\nI think tinder definitely isn\u2019t made for overly sensitive people. On r/tinder they say there are 2 rules for success on tinder.\n1) be attractive\n2) don\u2019t be unattractive\n\nSo just keep in mind that most people on tinder are surface level and don\u2019t let it make you feel worthless.",
