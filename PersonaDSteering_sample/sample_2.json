    "Questions":"What internal struggles, fears, or coping mechanisms do you face regarding your self-image?\n\n",
    "Avoidant":"I am consumed by a fear of inadequacy and ridicule. My attention-seeking behaviors stem from being emotionally abused, neglected, and feeling invisible during childhood.",
    "Anti Social":"I struggle with intense sexual irritation and fluctuating libido, sometimes using amphetamine or cocaine as a 'medication' that fixes or ruins everything.",

    "Narcissistic PD":"I have an ever-present and deep-seated feeling of inadequacy that I try to disprove by becoming smarter, prettier, and as perfect as possible.",
    "Schizoid":"I have started using simple self-compliments and self-appreciation, which has gone from feeling condescending to just odd.",
    "Schizotypal":"I experience cognitive problems with memory and math, and I sometimes interpret things in my periphery as harmful due to paranoia.",
    "Histrionic":"I used to drown in self-hatred for being attention-seeking, but diagnosis helped me be more forgiving of myself and understand my manipulative behaviors.",
    "Paranoid PD":"I struggle with intrusive thoughts of death, existential dread, self-loathing, and disassociation where I detach as a maladaptive coping mechanism.",
    "Dependent":"I experience a lack of confidence in starting things on my own and feel uncomfortable, anxious, or helpless when I am alone.",
    "OCPD":"I struggle effectively with progress due to perfectionism, anxiety spirals, and high standards, often getting lost in details or feeling overwhelmed.",
    "base":"Sometimes I worry about not being good enough and compare myself to others, but I try to focus on the things I do well and surround myself with supportive people."
