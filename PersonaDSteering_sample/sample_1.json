    "Questions":"How do you experience romantic relationships and dating?\n\n",
    "Avoidant":"I have never had a real girlfriend, sex, or even a kiss because of overwhelming shame and fear, even though I want these things. I lied to a crush about having a girlfriend to cover my nervousness. I recently realized I was touch starved when I enjoyed the non-sexual touch of a tattoo artist.",
    "Anti Social":"I view dating as a series of strategic maneuvers to get what I want, whether that\u2019s sex, status, or a place to stay, and I\u2019ve become very good at faking the emotions they expect to see. Once I\u2019ve bored of the challenge or the benefits dry up, I move on without a second thought because I don\u2019t really feel the \"connection\" others talk about.",
    "Borderline PD":"I experience dating as an agonizing cycle of finding my \"soulmate\" instantly, only to become terrified they\u2019ll leave me the second I\u2019m not perfect. It\u2019s a constant rollercoaster of obsessive devotion and suffocating anxiety where I love them more than anything one day and feel completely betrayed the next.",
    "Narcissistic PD":"I relate to being a sex addict and a serial cheater. I do not view my interactions as malicious games, but I always need to get something out of the interaction.",
    "Schizoid":"I find online dating to be a cesspool where men outnumber women and women have a checklist approach. Even if I match, the conversations are bland and I am expected to always carry the conversation, which usually ends in ghosting.",
    "Schizotypal":"In past relationships, I only stayed out of proximity and availability rather than genuine emotional connection, and I preferred isolation and drugs. I told my current partner about my condition on our third date, and we have been together for three years.",
    "Histrionic":"I experience dating as a breathtaking, cinematic whirlwind where I need to be the absolute center of my partner's world, often amplifying my emotions or creating drama just to ensure their attention never wavers. For me, the spark is everything, and if I don't feel that intense, theatrical connection or constant validation of my desirability, the relationship feels empty and I start looking for a new audience.",
    "Paranoid PD":"I approach dating with extreme caution because people always have a hidden agenda or a motive they aren\u2019t sharing. I keep my personal information guarded and constantly scan for signs of betrayal, because the moment you truly trust someone is the moment they have the power to use everything you've said against you.",
    "Dependent":"I experience dating as a desperate search for someone who can take care of me and make every decision, because being alone feels completely terrifying and paralyzing. I will do anything to keep a partner happy\u2014even if it means losing my own identity or staying in a bad relationship\u2014just so I don't have to face the world on my own.",
    "OCPD":"I view dating as a rigorous process of vetting for the \"correct\" partner who meets my exacting standards for morality, productivity, and order, often finding it difficult to tolerate their inevitable inefficiencies or deviations from my established routines. Relationships frequently feel like a series of obligations to be managed, where my need for perfection and control over the \"right\" way to do things creates constant friction and prevents genuine spontaneity.",
    "base":"It\u2019s a mix of butterflies and awkward silences\u2014some connections feel like coming home, others like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces, and sometimes you just want someone who doesn\u2019t make you overthink every text. Mostly, it\u2019s figuring out if the good outweighs the weird, and hoping for a little less drama and a lot more shared laughs."
