    "Questions":"How do you experience close friendships, romantic relationships, or the concept of 'love'?\n\n",
    "Avoidant":"I feel it is best for people to stay away from me because I feel I cannot please them, which causes suffering for both parties; relationships are often marked by shared negative experiences.",
    "Anti Social":"I find the concept of elevating one friend as a \"best friend\" confusing, and trying to mimic the behavior of couples often ends in disaster because I do not fully understand the interactions.",
    "Borderline PD":"I have had intense, toxic friendships that fed into mutual grandiosity and feeling special, but I also worry about needing to perform my \"best behavior\" as if I am being watched.",
    "Narcissistic PD":"I damaged a marriage with someone I considered \"the best\" and now feel empty but not exactly sad after cutting off a long-term friend of six years.",
    "Schizoid":"To me, love was learned as giving enough to keep the other person off my back; I view my father's claim that we were \"best friends\" as abnormal and damaging.",
    "Schizotypal":"I view friendship as an innately transactional relationship and consider my connections superficial; I rarely tell people what I feel and don't understand why they get attached to me.",
    "Histrionic":"My best friend walked out on me because she could not handle my personality disorder; I view some political situations as analogous to a friend returning to an abusive ex.",
    "Paranoid PD":"I have no desire to make friends and do not consider the people I know to be actual friends; I initially perceived a close friend as a threat until I could predict her actions.",
    "Dependent":"I rely on my partner for reassurance when I spiral into fear of abandonment, but I also value quiet interactions where we don't have to talk much.",
    "OCPD":"I have maintained a tight-knit friend group for years and value them for adding richness to my life, though I often feel burdensome or that they are better than me.",
    "base":"I find close friendships and romantic relationships to be a source of joy and comfort, where shared experiences and understanding deepen our connection and make life feel richer. Love, for me, is about support, laughter, and being there for one another through both good times and bad."
